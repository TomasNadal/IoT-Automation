Backend (Flask) Changes:
a. We modified the Arduino data reception endpoint to emit Socket.IO events.
b. We addressed the JSON serialization issue for datetime objects by updating the Signal model's to_dict() method.
c. We used the application-wide SocketIO instance to emit events from within Flask routes.
Frontend (React) Changes:
a. We set up a DataContext to manage the global state of controladores and connected stats.
b. We created a WebSocketContext to handle real-time updates via Socket.IO.
c. We updated the WebSocketContext to process incoming data and update the DataContext accordingly.

Key Lessons:

Bridging HTTP and WebSocket:
We learned how to emit Socket.IO events from HTTP endpoints in Flask, allowing real-time updates to be sent when new data is received via HTTP POST.
JSON Serialization:
We addressed the common issue of serializing complex objects (like datetime) to JSON by modifying the to_dict() method in our models.
React Context API for State Management:
We used React's Context API to manage global state (DataContext) and handle WebSocket connections (WebSocketContext), providing a clean way to share data across components.
Real-time Data Processing:
In the WebSocketContext, we implemented logic to process incoming data, update it according to the controlador's configuration, and integrate it with existing data.
Separation of Concerns:
By separating data management (DataContext) from real-time communication (WebSocketContext), we created a more modular and maintainable structure.
Error Handling and Logging:
We implemented error handling and logging in both the backend and frontend to help with debugging and improving user experience.
Efficient Data Updates:
Instead of replacing all data when receiving updates, we implemented a system to update only the relevant parts of the state, improving efficiency.
WebSocket Connection Management:
We implemented proper WebSocket connection and disconnection handling, including reconnection logic and error handling.
